## Projects

### Crazy Rydes Serverless 

The Serverless Web Application project is a scalable and secure web app built with AWS services. It includes a serverless backend using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, user authentication with Amazon Cognito, data storage with DynamoDB, and frontend development with AWS Amplify. Get started by cloning the repo, setting up AWS resources, and deploying the app for a hands-on experience.

### Smart Slide
Smart program to automate slide transitions in a slideshow using presenter speech as input to eliminate the need to manually change slides each time, making meetings and presentations more efficient.

ML and NLP potential as well.

### PixScout: A 2D Odyssey

My first project in LUA. Never knew any LUA before this so it's still a work in progress haha.

A 2D game with animated sprites, follow-around camera, and in-game physics. 

Now implemented modular game loading to allow users to load different games from menu.

### Rubiks Cube Visualizer/Solver ðŸ§Š

As a child, I always found Rubik's Cubes intriguing - the infinite faces, the twisting directions, and the challenge of solving the cube. I developed this 3D visualization program using Python along with NumPy and Matplotlib.

### Amazon Clone (In Development) ðŸ›’

I'm currently working on building a functioning Amazon Clone with user authentication, Stripe-enabled payments, and a responsive UI using React/Redux.

### Project Vendo (In Development) ðŸš€

Project Vendo aims to provide a coordinated, easy, and time-saving solution to manage digital engagements for small businesses. It will allow users to connect their social media accounts (such as Facebook and Instagram), schedule posts, and gain insights on audience reach using analytics.

I'm currently in the initial stages of development, exploring the [Meta/Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/) and setting up the backend for user authentication and social media integration.

Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting project!

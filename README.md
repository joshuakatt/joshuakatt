## Projects

### [Rubiks Cube Visualizer/Solver](https://github.com/joshuakatt/Rubiks_Cube_3D_Visualizer_Solver)

  As a child, I always found Rubiks Cubes intriguing. 
  
  The seemingly infinite faces a cube could have, the directions in which it could be twisted, and of course, the ways in which one could solve the cube.
        
  I developed this 3D visualization program using Python along with NumPy and Matplotlib
  
### [Amazon Clone (in dev)](https://github.com/joshuakatt/Amazon-Clone)

A functioning Amazon Clone with User authentication, Stripe enabled payments, and responsive UI built on React/Redux.
  
### [Project Vendo (in dev)]()
  I want to create a coordinated, easy, and time-saving solution to manage digital engagements for small business,
  
  I'm currently in the inital stages of development where I'm figuring out how the [Meta/Facebook API]("https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/") and my back-end will connect to allow users to login and connect social media accounts.
  
  I plan to allow users to connect their social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram) and schedule when their posts go out. More importantly, I wish to provide the user with insights on which type of posts are doing best, and how to reach a wider audience using analytics.
  
  I plan to implement this by Guiding the user in the right steps and warning the user when wrong steps are being made.
  
  Definetely my most exciting project yet.
